<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Two methods having the same implementation are suspicious. It might be that something else was intended. Or the duplication is intentional, which
becomes a maintenance burden.</p>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
class Circle(var radius: Int) {
  def width_=(size: Int) {
    radius = size / 2
    updateShape()
  }

  def height_=(size: Int) { // Noncompliant: duplicates width_
    radius = size / 2
    updateShape()
  }

  def updateShape() = {...}
}
</pre>
<p>If the identical logic is intentional, the code should be refactored to avoid duplication. For example, by having both methods call the same method
or by having one implementation invoke the other.</p>
